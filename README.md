# Password Generator
An automated password generator based on criteria you select.

## Description

This web page allows you to create a unique password. The user selects various criteria to be used for the generated password.
The user selects password length (# of characters), and which character sets to use: Numbers, Special Characters, Upper Case Letters and Lower Case Letters.
From the selected criteria the computer will choose random characters to create a password.

This is a tool to create a unique password that is secure/safe.
Its creates complex passwords quickly and efficiently.

During this project I learned how to implement various loops, functions and arrays within Javascript to implement the password generator.
